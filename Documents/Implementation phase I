1. Data Collection
Collected datasets from publicly available sources, including:

Food.com Recipe and Nutrition Dataset for ingredients and calorie data.

Archanaâ€™s Kitchen IndianFood Dataset for region-specific Indian meal recipes.

WHO and USDA dietary guidelines for age- and condition-specific nutritional needs.

User input data included:
âœ… Age, gender, height, weight, and activity level
âœ… Dietary preference (veg/non-veg/vegan)
âœ… Specific health conditions (e.g., diabetes, pregnancy, heart disease)
âœ… Stress level responses for chatbot analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed missing or inconsistent entries in recipe ingredients and nutrition fields.

Standardized units (e.g., calories per serving, grams of protein/fat/carbs).

Calculated BMI using weight and height and categorized users into:
âœ… Underweight
âœ… Normal
âœ… Overweight
âœ… Obese

Grouped foods by nutritional category and suitability for specific health conditions.

B. Statistical Analysis & Insights
Assessed average nutritional values across different meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

Analyzed ingredient frequency to recommend commonly available and healthy options.

Compared nutritional needs across different user profiles (age groups, conditions).

Identified the caloric balance between energy intake and activity level.

C. Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
Generated:
âœ… Bar plots showing macronutrient distribution by meal type
âœ… Heatmaps highlighting correlations between user BMI and calorie requirements
âœ… Pie charts of dietary categories (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, condition-specific meals)

3. Dashboard Creation in Power BI
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for nutrition and wellness analysis.

Key features included:
âœ… User-wise nutrition breakdown (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
âœ… Line graphs showing user progress over days/weeks
âœ… Comparison of daily meal plans and nutritional targets
âœ… Interactive filters to analyze data by user type or health condition
âœ… Visualization of stress chatbot inputs (mood trends over time)

4. Key Insights from EDA & Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Users with sedentary lifestyles require 20â€“30% fewer calories than active individuals.
ðŸ“Œ Diabetic users need low-sugar, high-fiber meals; vegetarian diets work well.
ðŸ“Œ Pregnancy-based nutrition planning requires higher iron, calcium, and calorie intake.
ðŸ“Œ Plant-based meals are consistently lower in saturated fats and higher in fiber.
ðŸ“Œ Stress patterns, identified via the chatbot, often correlate with meal skipping and poor hydration.

5. Outcome of Phase 1
âœ… Structured and cleaned nutrition datasets ready for ML integration.
âœ… Extracted essential features for personalized meal and activity planning.
âœ… Developed initial version of Power BI dashboard for nutrition analytics.
âœ… Validated dataset and labels for specific user types (e.g., diabetic-friendly meals).
âœ… Prepared user input schema for integration into the NutriFit AI planner interface.
